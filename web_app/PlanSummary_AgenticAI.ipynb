        "\n",
        "* chat_interface(planning_state: AgentState) function:\n",
        "  * Purpose: This function enables a conversational interaction with the user, allowing them to ask questions about their generated financial plan. The AI assistant uses the context of the complete financial plan to provide relevant and specific answers.\n",
        "  * Input: It takes the planning_state (the final AgentState after the financial plan has been created) as input. This state contains all the user_info and plan_summaries.\n",
        "  * Initialization: If planning_state is None (meaning no plan was generated), it exits. Otherwise, it sets up an introductory message and an empty conversation_history list to store previous exchanges.\n",
        "  * Context Creation: It constructs a SystemMessage that serves as the AI's internal context. This message includes the user_info and all Financial Plan Summaries from the planning_state. This ensures the AI always has the complete financial picture when responding.\n",
        "  * Interactive Loop: It enters a while True loop to allow continuous interaction:\n",
        "    1. User Input: It prompts the user for a question. If the user types 'exit', 'quit', or 'bye', the chat ends.\n",
        "    2. Message Construction: It builds a list of messages for the LLM, starting with the SystemMessage context, followed by the conversation_history, and finally the current HumanMessage from the user.\n",
        "    3. LLM Invocation: It calls the llm.invoke() method with the constructed list of messages to get a response from the language model.\n",
        "    4. History Update: The user's input and the AI's response are appended to the conversation_history to maintain conversational memory.\n",
        "    5. Context Management: It keeps the conversation_history length manageable (e.g., last 10 messages) to prevent context window overflow and maintain efficiency.\n",
        "    6. Display Response: The AI's response is printed to the console."
